Well at least that’s how I see it. From my research, [Metal Pay](http://metalpay.com) started out as a new alternative to Bitcoin that focussed on P2P payments. It used to look pretty boring (i.e shit) but it seems they’ve hired a Designer / iOS Engineer gun to spruce things up. They’ve posted some teasers for their new app and it is honestly the nicest looking UI I’ve seen in crypto. You can grab a sneak peek of the new UI and features [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrY3rhLM8DU&feature=youtu.be)

Metal seem to be positioning themselves as a direct competitor to things like Venmo, Apple Cash, Snapcash and all those other mobile payment things people use. The real sugar behind the project is their authentication method, "PoPP" - Proof of Processed Payments. I still don't know how it works exactly, but every time you send money to someone you get 5% cashback in the form of MTL??
