A bunch of FUD was spreading around the Twittersphere late last year about how Bitcoin was using a week’s worth of energy to process just one transaction. Obviously that’s bad for the environment — but has anyone ever audited how much electricity the fiat economy consumes? lel.  

That aside, if you’re still feeling a lil guilty – [WePower](https://wepower.network/) has a new ICO on the way aiming to create a new system for trading green energy via the Blockchain, and it looks SICK. Some of you might be aware of [PowerLedger](https://powerledger.io/), from what I can see it looks like a direct competitor. WePower’s design has got it goin on though. What really got my juices goin is that WePower had quite a lengthy process to sign up for the ICO. You had to Whitelist your ETH address, and also verify your identity. This is a little annoying, but it shows the team are dedicated to making sure every component of their company is compliant!
