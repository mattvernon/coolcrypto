Porn is a part of every day life and anyone that says they don’t watch it is a fucking liar. It’s always at the forefront of technology, adopting new processes before the mainstream. PornHub integrated VR content into their platform like it aint no thing, and they're even trying to film porn in space ffs. It only makes sense that we should have a token for Porn. [SpankChain](http://spankchain.com) seems like a joke, but it's a serious project with great applications.   

Due to the nature of their work, PayPal, Stripe and all the other big financial institutions treat pornstars and sex workers like garbage, so they’re forced to use dodgy grey market card processing sites that take a 50 PERCENT CUT on all transactions. SpankChain is changing that by decentralizing it all. Opening up payment processing for anyone, no matter what the hell you do for it.

On top of this, they're also creating a decentralized live cam site, similar to Chaturbate – where models and performers can earn crypto.

Their site also has some hella nice illustrations.
