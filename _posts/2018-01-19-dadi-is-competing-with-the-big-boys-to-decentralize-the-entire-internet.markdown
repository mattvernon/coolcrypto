[DADI](http://dadi.cloud) is one of those tokens I'm really bullish on at the moment. Their site and branding is so good for a crypto startup, and I'm a massive fan of the fact that their technology is currently being used RIGHT NOW, on the internet, by some legit companies. I'm still not entirely across the token model, but it basically looks like they've built a bunch of web services (an API Layer, a CMS?, a CDN + more) and they're looking to power all of these services through a decentralized network of miners. They're going into an extremely tough market, currently owned by Amazon and Google – so they've got a lot of work ahead of them. Their ICO is happening EXTREMELY SOON, so if you're keen – jump in right now and start the verification process.

Let's hope the token ticker is #DADDY.
